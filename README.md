## Contains the main code for the prompt mentioned

<H5> My code contains using an open-source API called SerpAPI (https://serpapi.com/), where it lets the user use it's auto generated API and use Python on it. I utilied the API and made a Python file where I basically go through the different results given through the google search queries that I define would be fun for people to do from 9AM - 9PM and use pandas to create the end product. The dataframe created at the end, df1, contains the results that I made and has it's format like the example-plan given to us. </H5>
